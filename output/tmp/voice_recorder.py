Voice Recorder Module

This module provides a VoiceRecorder class that allows recording audio 
using the sounddevice library and saving it as a file.

Dependencies:
- sounddevice

Example usage:
    recorder = VoiceRecorder(duration=10, output_path="./recordings/", file_format="wav")
    recording_path = recorder.start_record()
    print("Recording saved at:", recording_path)
